## How It's Made:
I used Kotlin in Android Studio to make this app.


## Lessons Learned:
This project was my introduction to using databases in Android development to save information. In this particular project, I used Room database. 
Furthermore, I incorporated timers and sound files. However, there was a problem with the sound file continuing to play when it shouldn't, so I removed it from the final version. 

## Things to improve:
One thing I would improve would be to figure out how to have the sound file play only when I want it to play. I would also incorporate gifs of the exercises
instead of the static images
